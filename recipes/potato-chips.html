    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      A potato chip (often just chip, or crisp in British and Irish English) is
      a thin slice of potato that has been either deep fried, baked, or air
      fried until crunchy. They are commonly served as a snack, side dish, or
      appetizer. The basic chips are cooked and salted; additional varieties are
      manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including herbs,
      spices, cheeses, other natural flavors, artificial flavors, and additives.
