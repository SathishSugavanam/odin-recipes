    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A hamburger (or burger for short) is a food consisting of fillings 
        —usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside 
        a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, 
        lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such 
        as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", 
        often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently
         placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is 
         called a cheeseburger.
