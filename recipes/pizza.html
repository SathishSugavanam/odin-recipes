    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian
      origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based
      dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients
      (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham,
      etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a
      wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person
      who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
